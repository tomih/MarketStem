##Terminology
* Channel - A PubNub endpoint used to stream a specific type of data.
* Asset - Anything that can be traded on the supported exchanges above.
* Market - A pair of assets that can be traded for each other.

##Data Format
* Asset - An uppercase identifier three characters in length, e.g., `USD`.
* Market - Two tradable asset identifiers concatenated together, e.g., `BTCUSD`.  The second asset is the asset for which the market is priced in.
* Timestamps - All timestamps are represented as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601" target="_blank">ISO 8601</a> formatted strings, e.g., `2014-04-20T10:57:55-07`.

##Service Architecture
The backend is a distributed <a href="http://storm.incubator.apache.org/" target="_blank">Storm Cluster</a> deployed to AWS EC2.  Each market resource, e.g., `ticker.KRAKEN.BTCUSD`, has a dedicated thread that repeatedly polls its respective exchange service API. Exchange data requests are set to poll as frequent as possible while respecting exchange rate limits and to prevent retrieval of duplicate cached data. If the exchange provides neither piece of information, each resource is polled for at most once per five seconds. The data is then normalized to a common data model and published to PubNub.

##Temporary Limitations
The following limitations can be easily removed with proper funding.  If you would like to see this service scale please donate below.

*  Only 20 clients (unique ip addressses) can connect per day because we are using <a href="http://www.pubnub.com/pricing/" target="_blank">PubNub's free service</a>.
*  Only 30 bid and ask orders in total are included in the Market Depth data because of the 1.7K message size limit under PubNub's free service.  This is increased to 7.2K under their paid service.
*  In an effort to reduce wasted network traffic, only the following assets are supported for Market Depth data.  However, all assets offered by an exchange are supported for Ticker data.
        USD, EUR, GBP, HKD, CNY, AUD, CHF, SEK, DKK, SGD, NOK, RUR, KRW, CAD, JPY, GHS, BTC, LTC, NMC, NVC, PPC, FTC, TRC, WDC, XPM, DVC, DGC, UTC, XDG, XRP, XVN.

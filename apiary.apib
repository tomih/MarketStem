 **PubNub Subscription Key:** `sub-c-7dfa531a-d8c5-11e3-bd4d-02ee2ddab7fe`

##Terminology
* Channel - A PubNub endpoint used to stream a specific type of data, i.e., `ticker.BITSTAMP` streams all tickers for the exchange BITSTAMP.
* Asset - Anything that can be traded on the supported exchanges above.
* Market - A pair of assets that can be traded for each other.  The first asset is considered the trade asset and the second is the price asset.
* Market Depth - See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_book_(trading)#Book_depth" target="_blank">Order Book Depth</a>.

##Data Format
* Exchange - Uppercase string, e.g., `BTCE`.
* Asset - Three character uppercase string, e.g., `USD`.
* Market - Two tradable asset identifiers concatenated together, e.g., `BTCUSD`.  The second asset is the asset for which the market is priced in.
* Timestamps - Represented as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601" target="_blank">ISO 8601</a> formatted strings, e.g., `2014-05-04T23:31:26Z`.
* Numbers - See <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/math/BigDecimal.html#toPlainString" target="_blank">Java's BigDecimal plain string format</a>.

##Service Architecture
The backend consists of a globally distributed network of failover nodes. 
Nodes consist of a collection of services that are each responsible for their own resource, e.g., all tickers for the exchange Kraken`ticker.KRAKEN`.
Failover is handled on a resource level. If a resource fails to check in within two minutes an identical resource service from another node will take over. 
Each resource service repeatedly polls its respective exchanges' service. By default, each resource is limited to poll at most once every five seconds 
(can be increased if needed), e.g., all tickers will be collected from Kraken every five seconds.  The rate of polling is further limited by individual exchange service rate-limits or by the duration that data is cached by the respective exchange service. 
Once the market data is retrieved it is then normalized to a common data model and published to PubNub.


##Temporary Limitations
The following limitations can be easily removed with proper funding.  If you would like to see this service scale please donate below.

*  Only publishing to the channel `ticker` to serve as demo until there is any further interest.
*  Only 100 clients (unique ip addressses) can connect per day because we are using <a href="http://www.pubnub.com/pricing/" target="_blank">PubNub's Go Cloud Basic Service</a>.
